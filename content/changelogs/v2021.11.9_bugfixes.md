As with any big Among Us update, Roles and Cosmicubes had some bugfix patches:

# 2021.12.14

_Network version: 2021.12.14_

This release adds an UseDtls flag to the regionInfo format, this allows disabling DTLS for server connections via a new parameter in the RegionInfo file.

It also adds an extra byte to the handshake, purpose currently unknown. On PC, its value is set to `0`.

# 2022.2.8s

This version changes the matchmaking system: Hosting and joining a game now runs over HTTP instead of via Hazel packets.

This update added the friend list and a new April Fools joke: Horse mode
