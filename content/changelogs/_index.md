This section lists the technical changes in each release of Among Us.

Every Among Us release has a letter behind it identifying the platform the release belongs to. In general releases that only differ by a letter should be mostly the same, except for platform specific features, like login to a specific platform or crossplay limitations.

| Letter | Platform        |
| ------ | --------------- |
|        | **Desktop**     |
| e      | Epic Games      |
| i      | Itch            |
| m      | Windows Store   |
| s      | Steam           |
|        | **Mobile**      |
| a      | Android         |
| o      | iOS/iPadOS      |
|        | **Console**     |
| n      | Nintendo Switch |
| x      | Xbox One/Series |
| _none_ | Playstation 4/5 |

The Steam, Epic and Itch versions are the preferred versions for modding: the Windows Store version has some small quirks which make it less preferred. If you do not currently own Among Us, we recommend to buy the Itch version, as it comes with a Steam key next to the Itch download.

The phone versions can join custom servers through the deeplink method but client side modding isn't as easy as on Desktop, so client side mods generally don't support the phone version, although they are supported by custom servers. NOTE: due to a bug in 2021.11.9 and 2021.12.15 phones currently cannot join custom servers.

The console versions do not support client mods or custom servers. As a result this wiki doesn't document these versions at all.
