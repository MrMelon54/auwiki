# Contributing to AUWiki

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute. We really welcome contributions, so we can build something great as a community.

If you haven't already, join the [Reactor Discord](https://reactor.gg/discord), as we're usually discussing in there.

- We're using Github's project tool to keep track of stuff we want to do. There's a board for [writing sections](https://github.com/auwiki/auwiki/projects/1), but also a board for [technical stuff](https://github.com/auwiki/auwiki/projects/2). If you want to take up one of these tasks, contact miniduikboot to assign you to a task. This hopefully stops multiple people from working on the same topic.

If you're having questions, feel free to contact miniduikboot:

- On Discord, contact miniduikboot#2965. His DM's are open in the Reactor Discord.
- Otherwise, send an email: mini@duikbo.at

# How can I contribute?

## Finding typo's

We're just humans and we make spelling missteaks. If you find something, open a small PR to fix it. Thanks!

## Writing/Modifying a section

If you're writing something more significant, discuss with us first to prevent double work. Contact us or open a Github issue with your suggestion and an outline of the page.

While writing, look at how the sections around you are structured. For consistency we'd like all articles to look more or less similar. To get a local preview of the page, check [the development guide](./DEVELOPING.md)

When you're finished with your section, open a pull request. If it's still somewhat unfinished, we can also review a draft, please send in a draft pull request.
We'll be reviewing it for correctness and style. It's possible that the review goes around a few times, although we hope to reduce the list of blocking comments each iteration.

## Reviewing a PR

If you're familiar with the Among Us protocol, you're welcome to review pull requests. Please prefer to focus on the following:

- Correctness: it is important that there are no factual inaccuracies on the wiki. If you find one, please report it
- Unclear phrasing: if a sentence doesn't flow well, feel free to suggest a replacement.
- Typos: please spot and correct.
- Keep in mind that articles don't need to be perfect on the first PR; try not to suggest completely new articles, make a note and they can be added later down the line. PR's should be limited to a single article to keep them manageable.

Please keep your feedback constructive: it should focus on the work and not the person who wrote it. It is very helpful if you can give specific suggestions on how people can improve their article.
Remember there's a human on the other side of the line, please be nice :)
