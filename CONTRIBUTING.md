# Contributing to AUWiki

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute. We really welcome contributions, so we can build something great as a community.

If you haven't already, join the [Reactor Discord](https://reactor.gg/discord), as we're usually discussing in there.

- We're using Github's project tool to keep track of stuff we want to do. There's a board for [writing sections](https://github.com/auwiki/auwiki/projects/1), but also a board for [technical stuff](https://github.com/auwiki/auwiki/projects/2). If you want to take up one of these tasks, contact miniduikboot to assign you to a task. This hopefully stops multiple people from working on the same topic.

If you're having questions, feel free to contact miniduikboot:

- On Discord, contact miniduikboot#2965. His DM's are open in the Reactor Discord.
- Otherwise, send an email: mini@duikbo.at

# How can I contribute?

## Finding typo's

We're just humans and we make spelling missteaks. If you find something, open a small PR to fix it. Thanks!

## Writing/Modifying a section

If you're writing something more significant, discuss with us first to prevent double work.

While writing, look at how the sections around you are structured. For consistency we'd like all articles to look more or less similar.

When you're finished with your section, open a pull request. If you have a draft you want feedback on, open a PR as well, but mark it as draft so we know how far you are with your section. We'll be reviewing it for correctness and style. It's possible that the review goes around a few times

## Reviewing a PR

If you're familiar with the Among Us protocol, you're welcome to review pull requests. Please prefer to focus on the following:

- Correctness: it is important that there are no factual inaccuracies on the wiki. If you find one, please report it
- Unclear phrasing: if a sentence doesn't flow well, feel free to suggest a replacement.
- Typo's: please spot and correct.
- If you're missing a certain piece of content, please make a remark, but don't consider it blocking: we want to merge good articles, they don't have to be perfect yet. Improvements can be made later and if your suggestion involves adding another article, that's definitely out of scope for this one.

Please keep your feedback constructive: it should focus on the work and not the person who wrote it. It is very helpful if you can give specific suggestions on how people can improve their article.
